# sudoku-solver

# Version 1
 Version 1 have alot of amateurish decision,just think a second then try to write code,v1 repo going to unmanageable project,
 And I have to choose apply what I learn in this year about manageable projects,unmutable methods with functional programing,
 and the most important thing write unit Test,

# Version 2
 Version 2:I tried to apply what I thought , project codes much more maintainable,and look like much more functional :D
 But contains strictly Test,
 But version 2 still going unresolved sudoku examples

# Version 3
 My other decision is I have to get some help M.I.T. lesson videos cause my methods cant fill all sudoku boxs,
 And the lesson videos have a great idea , you dont have to write all possibilties the Puzzle ,just write invariant rules with methods
 then let the processors to solve puzzle with  the huge processing capacity
 
 ## Version 3 can solve sudoku examples...

# it was a fun and instructive process for me
